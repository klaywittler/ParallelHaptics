# ParallelHaptics

The kinematic and dynamic model for a DELTA robot was derived in order to next implement a controller that takes advantage of these characteristics that parallel robots provide. The kinematic and dynamic model of a 7-DOF human arm is also derived through the application of the Newton-Euler equations of motion. Together, the models were used to simulate haptic interactions.

This shows the response of a simple interface were the controller imposes a virtual table top on a ball that would be falling as a demonstration.
